The programe is provided by Zhuhong, 2015, 5, 11

And it depends on the "xdrfile" library!


Firstly, the C++ programe aims to :
Treat the xtc file (trajectory file) produced by the Gromacs running.
In gromacs, the produced trajectory file is treated using PBC, thus the the system is exactly in a box, BUT, 
the molecules may be divided into two parts located at two sides of a simulation box. THEN, we need to merge the "two parts" back to a molecule, 
just as the the real state. 

Then Hong Zhu wrote a C++ programe to achieve this!!!

Secondly, the "Trj_modify2.py" script is a similar python script to achieve the same function, but wrote in python and depends on the "MDAnalysis" library!
